To design a client-server API for a rich document editor, we need to consider the following key aspects:

1. Data Model
The data model should represent the document structure, including elements like text, formatting, images, tables, etc. A popular approach is to use a tree-like structure, such as HTML/XML or a custom JSON-based format, to represent the document hierarchy.

2. Operations
The API should expose operations for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting documents, as well as operations for manipulating specific parts of the document, such as inserting/deleting text, applying formatting, inserting images or tables, and so on.

3. Collaboration
If the document editor supports real-time collaboration, the API should handle synchronization of changes across multiple clients. This can be achieved using techniques like Operational Transformation (OT) or Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).

4. Versioning and History
The API should support versioning and history tracking for documents, allowing users to revert to previous versions or view the revision history.

5. Access Control and Permissions
Depending on the use case, the API may need to handle access control and permissions, such as read/write access for different users or groups.

6. Content Processing
The API may need to support content processing operations like spell checking, grammar checking, or conversion between different formats (e.g., converting from Markdown to HTML).

7. Communication Protocol
The API can use a standard protocol like HTTP/HTTPS for communication, with REST or GraphQL as the architectural style. For real-time collaboration, WebSockets or other bi-directional communication protocols may be more suitable.

8. Scalability and Performance
The API should be designed with scalability and performance in mind, considering factors like load balancing, caching, and optimizing for common operations.

### Here's a high-level overview of how the API could be structured:

1. Document Management

POST /documents: Create a new document
GET /documents/{id}: Retrieve a document
PUT /documents/{id}: Update a document
DELETE /documents/{id}: Delete a document

2. Document Editing

PATCH /documents/{id}/content: Update the document content (e.g., insert/delete text, apply formatting)
GET /documents/{id}/revisions: Retrieve the revision history for a document
POST /documents/{id}/revisions: Create a new revision for a document

3. Collaboration

POST /documents/{id}/subscribe: Subscribe to real-time updates for a document
POST /documents/{id}/changes: Broadcast changes made by a client to other subscribed clients

4. Content Processing

POST /documents/{id}/spell-check: Perform spell-checking on a document
POST /documents/{id}/convert: Convert a document from one format to another (e.g., Markdown to HTML)

5. Access Control

POST /documents/{id}/permissions: Set permissions for a document
GET /documents/{id}/permissions: Retrieve permissions for a document

This is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation would depend on the specific requirements, technologies used, and the trade-offs between complexity, performance, and scalability.
